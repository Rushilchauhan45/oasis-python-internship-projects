Project Title : Voice Assistant
----------------------------------

Type: Console Application (Beginner) / GUI + API Integration (Advanced)
Difficulty Level: Beginner to Advanced

Objective :
------------

👉 Create a Python-based Voice Assistant that can recognize user speech, perform simple tasks (time, date, greetings, Google search), and respond with both text and voice. This project introduces speech recognition, text-to-speech, and command processing concepts.

    [Option 4] Search the Web
        → Ask for search query → open browser with results
    [Option 5] Exit Program
        → Speak "Goodbye" → End Program
↓
Return to Listening State (unless Exit chosen)
↓
END
